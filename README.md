# Robotic Arm & MATLAB Kinematics Interface
## In our Course Project, “Robotic Arm & MATLAB Kinematics Interface,” seven of us, Laiba Shehzad (2021-BEE-009), Aroosa Bibi (2021-BEE-003), Palwasha Bibi (2021-BEE-015), Ayesha Shabbir Mirza (2021-BEE-004), Shanza Noor (2021-BEE-016), Afshan Bibi (2021-BEE-001), and Muneeba Bibi (2021-BEE-013) worked together to build a simple four-joint robotic arm and control it from MATLAB. As the group leader, I (Ayesha) set up our schedule, led the kinematics code (both forward and inverse), and put together our final report, poster, and presentation. Laiba handled the CAD modeling of the arm parts, Aroosa chose our electronic and mechanical components and made the bill of materials, and Palwasha drew the wiring diagrams and assembled all the cables. Shanza built the MATLAB GUI so we could send joint angles and see the arm move in 3D, and Afshan tried to link that GUI to our ESP32 board. Muneeba was supposed to test the whole system and debug problems, but because we ran into delays integrating the ESP32 with the GUI, she helped finalize our poster and report instead. Although our arm wasn’t fully functional by the testing deadline, we still completed the CAD model, the kinematics calculations in MATLAB, the user interface, and the detailed documentation, learning a lot about teamwork, problem solving, and project management along the way.
